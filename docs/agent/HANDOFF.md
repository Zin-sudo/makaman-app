## 0. HOW THIS FILE WAS WRONG, AND WHAT REPLACED IT

Until 2026-08-26 `docs/agent/HANDOFF.md` was a copy of the 86KB session log at the repo
root. That log describes `app/` as a **Vite/React** project with `theme.css`, `Users.jsx`,
`PrintPreview.jsx` and `src/lib/offlineQueue.js`. None of that exists. `app/` is a single
static dc-runtime `index.html`, and CONSTRAINTS §3 forbids rewriting it to React.

An agent following that log would have re-planned work that shipped weeks ago. The root
`HANDOFF.md` is kept as history; **this file is the living state**. Do not restore the old
one over it.

---

## 1. WHERE THE PROJECT ACTUALLY IS

`app/index.html` is **6,159 lines**, mirrored byte-identical to `app/Job Ticket System.dc.html`.
Twenty-six Playwright suites sit beside it. The backend is live on `igutjfezxkdncrcpvnqx`.

### 1.1 Shipped (verified in git, with the commit that did it)

| # | What | Commit |
|---|------|--------|
| A | Timezone selector removed — `OPERATING_TZ` is a constant (Africa/Tripoli, UTC+2). Accent swatches gone. 24h default; PDFs/ZIPs always 24h, the 12h toggle is screen-only. | `c2ab70b` |
| B | Top-bar coordinates on every tab; long-press copies them with a 2s "Coordinates Copied!" banner; coordinates print beside the Well No. at footnote size. | `dabbbc9` |
| C | Oilfield / well / rig capped at 10 characters (`LOCATION_MAX`, `clampLoc`). **Customer deliberately uncapped** — company names run long. | `a249882` |
| E | Admin/ops can force a ticket number on an in-progress ticket and approve on a technician's behalf, with a forced-action notice and Activity attribution. | `eb01f51` |
| F | Real tablet/laptop layout for technicians — the phone bezel is gone at every width, column held to 760px, nav pinned centred. | `eb01f51`, `d96b512` |
| G | The numbering claim moved out of individual tickets into its own Account-tab section, transferable by handover or by an Admin override. | `d96b512` |
| H | Tools/crossover allocation is its own container, between the job-type-objective and ticket-header containers. | `d96b512` |
| — | Price lists re-imported: **2,610 rows** generated, **2,600 live** (336 recovered). `unit_cost` nullable. | `3876667`, `9b1e785` |
| — | Signup approval routed through the `admin-actions` Edge Function; outbox no longer jams on a refused write. | *this session* |

Earlier landed work, for orientation: real Supabase auth (`d3690ae`), the app on Supabase
(`c2ab70b`), per-ticket ZIP + monthly overview exports (`2fc71f8`), currency-aware decimals
(`fc57078`), DB-side item-code normalisation (`3974cb7`).

### 1.2 Test suites in `app/` (none of these were recorded anywhere before today)

`approval` (new), `assets`, `audit`, `auth`, `claim`, `clock`, `cloud`, `coalesce`, `coop`,
`currency`, `export`, `forced`, `geo`, `layout`, `lengthcap`, `numbering`, `observer`,
`office`, `office2`, `roles`, `search`, `sync`, `tabs`, `techreport`, `toast`, `wellgeo`.

`clock`, `wellgeo`, `lengthcap` and `forced` are the suites that pin items A, B, C and E.

**How to run one:**
```bash
cd app && python3 -m http.server 8934 &
npm install playwright-core --no-save          # from the repo root; not vendored
NODE_PATH=../node_modules node forced.test.js
```
They drive `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`. Budget ~60–120s each;
run them in small batches or a 7-suite batch will exceed a 2-minute tool timeout.

### 1.3 Still open

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Permission registry (P1.8)** | `permission_ID` / `permission_Name` / `Permission_Level` tables + an admin permissions page in Account. Underpins the three items below. **This is the next task.** |
| **Role-swap control** | Top-right control letting admin/ops act as Technician and swap back, appearing among technicians for assignment. |
| **Log-events container in Review** | Admin/ops need the event log surfaced inside the Review screen. |
| **Admin/ops unrestricted ticket access** | Full A–Z technician flow on tickets they opened, audit trail kept throughout. |
| **User deletion** | The Delete button now says plainly that deletion happens on the server (see §2.4). `admin-actions` has no `delete_user` action yet. |
| **App-design polish** | Card UI, sticky blurred headers, iOS toggles, empty states. **User asked for mockups to approve before any code.** |
| **Approved-ticket → master Excel** | PWA → DB → script → shared master file, with a download button for admin/ops/observer. **User asked to be questioned in detail first.** |
| **"Apper" skill** | After the Excel automation. |
| **Q1 rewording** | To "Tools Allocated Reclaimed or Back-to-Base?" — deferred until the backend is finished; DB (migration 0009) and app differ by one word today. |
| **Offline/online stress test** | Two devices taking one series number, ops edits during an offline log, etc. |
| **Migration 0002** | Applied to the DB but missing from `supabase/migrations/`. Do not rebuild the schema from files alone. |

## 2. THIS SESSION — SIGNUP APPROVAL

### 2.1 The symptom
An admin approves a pending sign-up. The row shows active. The person still cannot log in,
and the account reverts to pending.

### 2.2 The cause, confirmed against the live database
```sql
select policyname, cmd from pg_policies where tablename='profiles';
-- profiles_select_own   SELECT
-- profiles_select_staff SELECT
```
RLS is on and **only SELECT policies exist** — no INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE for any
signed-in client. The approval was a local `mutate()`, which `diffOps()` turned into a
`profiles` upsert on the generic outbox. Postgres refused it every time.

Two consequences, and the second is the worse one:
1. `refresh()` runs `hydrate()` after the drain and adopts the database's version, so the
   old `pending` row came straight back.
2. `outboxDrain()` stopped at the first failure to preserve ordering — correct for a lost
   connection, fatal for a refusal that will never succeed. The rejected profile row sat at
   the head of the queue and **blocked every later write on that device indefinitely**.

### 2.3 The fix
- `adminAction(action, payload)` invokes the `admin-actions` Edge Function, which already
  implemented `approve_signup`, `promote_role` and `create_technician`, each re-deriving the
  caller from their own JWT. The app had simply never called it.
- Approve, promote and create-account now go through it in cloud mode and only touch the
  replica once the server has said yes and `refresh()` has read the new row back. The demo
  store keeps its local path — `authMode: 'local'` is what the behaviour suites run on.
- **`profiles` is removed from the `diffOps` pair list.** A profile row can no longer enter
  the outbox at all.
- `outboxDrain()` now counts attempts. An op still holds its place while a retry is
  plausible, but after `OUTBOX_TRIES` (5) it is set aside into `makaman.outbox.refused.v1`
  and the queue moves on. The change itself stays in the replica; only the attempt to send
  it is abandoned, and the refusal is kept rather than dropped silently.

**No RLS policy was added to `profiles`** — CONSTRAINTS §4 forbids it, and it would let any
signed-in staff member promote themselves to Admin.

### 2.4 Deliberate loose end
Deleting a user is the same class of privileged write and `admin-actions` has no action for
it. Rather than remove the row locally and have `refresh()` put it back, the confirm dialog
now says so plainly in cloud mode. Wiring a `delete_user` action is listed in §1.3.

### 2.5 Verification
`app/approval.test.js` — 12 assertions, all passing. It proves `profiles` is absent from the
outbox pair list, that all three handlers reach the Edge Function, and — by driving the real
`outboxDrain` against a client that refuses every `profiles` write — that a permanently
refused op no longer blocks the write behind it, that the queue drains empty, and that the
refusal is recorded.

Re-ran for regressions: `roles` 11, `sync` 18, `numbering` 18, `layout` 13, `claim` 23,
`forced` 19, `lengthcap` 14 — **116 assertions, 0 failures**.

## 3. NEXT TASK — P1.8, the permission registry

Build the foundation, then the page. In this order, because everything else the user has
asked for reads from it:

1. **Schema.** `permissions` (`permission_id`, `permission_name`, `permission_level`) and
   `user_permissions` (per-user grant/revoke overriding the role default). RLS: everyone
   may read their own; only Admin may write. Ship as a numbered migration in
   `supabase/migrations/`.
2. **Seed** it from the role behaviour already in `index.html`, so the registry describes
   the app as it is rather than inventing a second answer.
3. **`hasPermission(key)`** as a single shared helper — FEATURE_LINKS §2 marks it a god
   node. Read from a hydrated map, never from a JWT claim (BLINDSPOTS B-7.2: a role change
   does not invalidate a token).
4. **Admin permissions page** in the Account tab, per-user toggles.
5. Only then the role-swap control and the Review log-events container, which both consume it.

### If blocked
Stop and log it here rather than guessing:
- Ten Waha price-list conflicts are parked in `backup.price_list_conflicts_20260820`. They
  need real item numbers from the user. **Never invent codes, average prices, or drop rows.**
- Supabase "leaked password protection" is still OFF and the seeded Admin password appeared
  in a chat transcript. Both need the user at the dashboard.

---

## 4. STANDING REMINDERS

- Push to **`claude/makaman-app`** only.
- Supabase project **`igutjfezxkdncrcpvnqx`**. Never touch `vaawlkmbhdbevkylclkf`
  (`makaman-libya`, the company website).
- After every edit to `app/index.html`: `cp` to `app/Job Ticket System.dc.html`, `cmp`, and
  `node --check` the extracted `<script type="text/x-dc">` block.
- No ternaries inside `{{ }}` — dc-runtime fails silently (BLINDSPOTS B-9.1).
- 110 price-list rows have `NULL unit_cost` and mean "quoted separately". They must never
  render as 0.00.
